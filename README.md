GIVING TO OPEN SOURCE
Open-source projects keep the internet humming—but they can’t do it without resources. Donate and support their awesome work.

What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

Prepare and share your project for collaboration
Contribute to the betterment of a project via pull requests
Organize an event
Mentor others
Donate directly to open source projects

RULES
Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

Details

The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.
